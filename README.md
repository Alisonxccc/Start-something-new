# Start-something-new
First project for green hand coder
I am new to the coding world. 
Coding is something I have interests in but never know how to code. 
I find coding hard and I dont' know where to start. 
Guessing that probably because I never really like it.
Just like watching somebody else doing it.
Shame on me.
